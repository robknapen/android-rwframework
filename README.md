android-rwframework
===================

Roundware V2.0 library for the Android OS. Use this library when building
Android apps that use the Roundware participatory, location-sensitive audio
platform (see www.roundware.org).

Roundware is a flexible, distributed framework which collects, stores,
organizes and re-presents audio content. Basically, it lets you collect
audio from anyone with a smartphone or web access, upload it to a central
repository along with its metadata and then filter it and play it back
collectively in continuous audio streams.
